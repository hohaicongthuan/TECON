# TECON

A Tetris clone with ASCII UI.

> __*Note #1: This project is incomplete. It's playable but some functions don't work as expected.*__

> __*Note #2: This repo was previously named "TETRIS" and now it's changed to "TECON" to save myself from any copyright infringement. I know that probably nobody's gonna care about this right now but I just wanna make one less possible problem that I have to deal with in my life.*__

> __*Note #3: The name "TECON" is just a quick dumb combination of "TETRIS" + "CONSOLE" â†’ "TECON" ðŸ˜‚*__

## RATIONALE

This was a homework project from a university class back in 2018. I was making it in collaboration with my friend, @AcezukyRockon ([her GitHub](https://github.com/AcezukyRockon)).

We were learning C++ at that time so be aware that the code doesn't look really professional (and sorry for the mixed comments between English and Vietnamese LOL), but at least it's playable.

We were so busy to complete and polish it and the professor didn't even remember about it at all so it's pretty much abandoned ***BUT*** still playable! ðŸ˜‚

I'm not archiving this repo yet just in case I wanna make any changes to this in the future, when I have some free time.

## HOW TO BUILD & PLAY?

The code in the repo is just a [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) project that you can open with... well... [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) (Visual Studio Community 2022 will work). Just build and run it, no dependencies are required.

Also, I've included a built binary file in the [`Release`](https://github.com/hohaicongthuan/TETRIS/releases) section so check that out if you don't wanna pull the repo and build it yourself or the project failed to build.

Use arrow keys to control (alternatively, <kbd>W</kbd>,<kbd>A</kbd>, <kbd>S</kbd>, and <kbd>D</kbd>). <kbd>Space</kbd> to pause, <kbd>F</kbd> to select (if I remember it correctly). <kbd>Escape</kbd> to exit.

It is recommended to set the size of the console window to 83 x 29 to have the best displaying. Also, the font size to 8 x 12.

Now it has some colours and can be paused.

## WHAT ABOUT LINUX & OTHER PLATFORMS?

Unfortunately, at that time, I was a super noob in Linux and I wasn't using one so there's no Linux or other platforms version of this game. And I don't plan to make a cross-platform version of this either, I just feel it's not worth the time. Maybe I will in the future, if I had a lot of spare time.

## WANNA CONTRIBUTE?

Be my guest! Any contributions are greatly appreciated!
