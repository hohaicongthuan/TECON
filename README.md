# TETRIS

__*Note: This project is incomplete. It's playable but some functions don't work as expected.*__

A project homework in a university class. I'm making it in collaboration with my friend, @AcezukyRO.

It is recommended to set the size of the console window to 83 x 29 to have the best displaying. Also, the characters' size to 8 x 12.

Now it has some colours and can be paused.
